# Feature F23: Project Origins Documentation

> **Feature ID:** F23  
> **Beads:** spark_k8s-1wf (F21)  
> **Source:** docs/plans/2026-02-04-product-branding-strategy.md Phase 1

## Goal

Write "Why spark_k8s" story to establish narrative hook and reduce onboarding friction.

**Problem:** DevOps don't understand Spark, Data doesn't understand K8s — communication gap causes failed deployments.

**Solution:** Lego-constructor approach with preset-based deployment.

**Vision:** Production-ready, not production-hostile.

## Context

From Product & Community Strategy Phase 1:
- "Write Project Origins" (1h) — Narrative hook
- Differentiates from "yet another Helm chart" positioning
