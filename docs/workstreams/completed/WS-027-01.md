## WS-027-01: Create pyproject.toml and Enforce Coverage

### Goal

**What must WORK after completing this WS:**
- `pyproject.toml` as single source of truth for Python tooling
- Coverage enforced at ≥80% in pytest config
- Unified ruff/black/mypy configuration

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] AC1: `pyproject.toml` created with `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`, `[tool.ruff]`, `[tool.black]`, `[tool.mypy]`
- [ ] AC2: `pytest.ini` removed (config migrated to pyproject.toml)
- [ ] AC3: Coverage enabled: `--cov=tests --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80`
- [ ] AC4: Ruff rules configured (E, F, W, I, UP, B, SIM, N)
- [ ] AC5: Black line-length = 120 (consistent with existing code)
- [ ] AC6: `requirements-dev.txt` created (pytest, pytest-cov, ruff, black, mypy, pre-commit)
- [ ] AC7: `python -m pytest` runs successfully with new config
- [ ] AC8: `ruff check .` returns 0 errors (or known exclusions documented)

### Files Changed

- `pyproject.toml` (NEW)
- `pytest.ini` (DELETE — migrated)
- `requirements-dev.txt` (NEW)
