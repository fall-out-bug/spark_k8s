## WS-026-02: Fix Deprecated Spark 4.x Properties

### Goal

**What must WORK after completing this WS:**
- All deprecated Spark properties replaced with modern equivalents in 4.1 charts
- Forward-compatible configs that work on both 3.5 and 4.x where possible

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] AC1: `spark.blacklist.enabled` replaced with `spark.excludeOnFailure.enabled` in spark-4.1 prod values
- [ ] AC2: `spark.blacklist.timeout` replaced with `spark.excludeOnFailure.timeout`
- [ ] AC3: Spark 3.5 configs keep old property names (still valid)
- [ ] AC4: Documentation notes on property rename added to migration guide
- [ ] AC5: All `helm template` commands pass
- [ ] AC6: Existing tests still pass

### Files Changed

- `charts/spark-4.1/environments/prod/values.yaml` (RENAME blacklist → excludeOnFailure)
- `charts/spark-4.1/environments/staging/values.yaml` (RENAME if applicable)
- `docs/recipes/deployment/migrate-35-to-41.md` (ADD property rename notes)
