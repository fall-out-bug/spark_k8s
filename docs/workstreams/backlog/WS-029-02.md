## WS-029-02: Add Dependabot, CODEOWNERS, and .dockerignore

### Goal

**What must WORK after completing this WS:**
- Dependabot auto-creates PRs for dependency updates (GitHub Actions, Docker, pip)
- CODEOWNERS defines review ownership for key areas
- .dockerignore reduces Docker build context size

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] AC1: `.github/dependabot.yml` configured for: github-actions (weekly), docker (weekly), pip (weekly)
- [ ] AC2: `.github/CODEOWNERS` created: charts/ → @chart-maintainers, docker/ → @docker-maintainers, tests/ → @qa
- [ ] AC3: `docker/.dockerignore` created (exclude .git, .sdp, docs, tests, charts, *.md)
- [ ] AC4: Each Docker context directory has appropriate `.dockerignore`
- [ ] AC5: Docker build context size reduced by ≥50%

### Files Changed

- `.github/dependabot.yml` (NEW)
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` (NEW)
- `docker/.dockerignore` (NEW)
- `docker/spark-4.1/.dockerignore` (NEW)
- `docker/spark/.dockerignore` (NEW)
